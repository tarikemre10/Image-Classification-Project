What I Set Out to Do
For this homework I built a complete image-classification pipeline that recognises five animal species—alpaca, bear, elephant, leopard and zebra—using the dataset. My goals were:

Train a small baseline model from scratch.
Run a series of controlled experiments where each candidate model differs from the baseline by exactly one change (e.g. transfer learning, extra augmentation, alternative backbone).
Design a proposed model that combines the best-performing ideas.
